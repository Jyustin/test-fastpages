    "I got 4142 points, which is like a 7/10. I feel like I could have done better if I wasn't rushing. On the MC I will make sure not to try to rush, or I will miss something small and get the question wrong. To be honest, the problem isn't going to be knowledge but rather time, so I could do more of these problems I guess so they are more familiar, but I think I need to work on more difficult topics like logic gates before I work on something easy like lists or dictionaries.\n",
