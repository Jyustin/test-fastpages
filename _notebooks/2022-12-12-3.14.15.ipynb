    "libraries and APIs are essentially prewritten code that can help you on complex problems. These libraries and APIs can also be used to not only write code easier and not develop everything on projects but also be the entire foundation of the code itself. I also learned to use documentation to understand code segments and libraries/APIS. Documentation should be looked at before using a library or tinkering with some code, as it gives you an understanding of the code you are working with and how you could work with it. lastly, understand that random expressions and the use of random algorithms will be tested on the AP EXAM. It is especially important to understand the random syntax for pseudocode on the AP Exam because there will definetly be problems on the exam with different random expressions. \n",
