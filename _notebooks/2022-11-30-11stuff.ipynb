    "these are an abstraction inside a program that hold a value. each variable has associated data storage that represents one value at a time, but that value can be a list or other collection that in turn contains multiple values.\n",

    "use good names when naming variables to make the code easy to read\n",
    "\n",
    "lists allow variables to be bundled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "you can add or remove variables from one list to another with .append\n",

    "\n",
    "I did the problems on the blog. I found that converting to decimal was a lot harder than conversions from binary to decimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "after doing the other problems I found that most topics are easy to understand but binary and assigning variables different values is kind of difficult. the binary is difficult because I sometimes just make math errors, and the other just requires some harder thinking to avoid making some simple error.
