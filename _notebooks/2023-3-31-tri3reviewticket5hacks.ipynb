    "Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations,, some of which are performed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers handle a lot of tasks at once\n",
    "\n",
    "running tasks can be done sequentially, in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "tasks are done one at a time in sequential programming (like conveyor belt)\n",
    "\n",
    "IN PARALLEL COMPUTING:\n",
    "\n",
    "parallel computing schedules tasks to be executed at same tme\n",
    "\n",
    "parallel computing overall processes data faster and it scales more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### simple Example \n",
    "\n",
    "Core 1: task A takes 45 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Core 2: task B takes 50 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Core 3: Task C takes 25 ms; task D takes 30 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Core 4: Task E takes 40 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Total time: 55 ms (core 3 runs task C and D in sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, 5 tasks are spread out between 4 cores,  and all complete tasks at once, finally being done when all cores finish their individual task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, if we run all tasks in sequential on 1 core, the time becomes much longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributive computing: we now distribute our tasks among dfferent computers, not just among 1 physical computer. This needs network connection. Can take longer if network is bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular computer has 2 identical processors which can run in parallel. Each process must be executed on 1 processor and each processor can only run 1 process at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "whats the minimum amount of time (approx) to execute all 3 processes when 2 processor run in paallel?\n",
    "\n",
    "process X: 50 sec\n",
    "\n",
    "process Y: 10 sec\n",
    "\n",
    "process Z: 30 sec\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this would take 50 seconds, as we can run process X on one processor while the other runs Y and Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "I WAS RIGHT!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty good example for why parallel is good, but how can we develop programs for parallel processing if we don't have multiple processors to test on?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference in execution time between runniing the 2 processes in parallel in place of running on single processor?\n",
    "\n",
    "sequential: 70 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel: 45 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "70 - 45 = 25 seconds\n",

    "My ans: difference of 25 seconds \n",
    "\n",
    "I was right\n",
    "\n",
    "difference of 25 seconds is pretty large and seems unrealistic, but I think it demonstrates why we need to optimize for parallel computing.\n",
