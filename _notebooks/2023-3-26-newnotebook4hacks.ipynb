    "This could also be a space complexity, as we can see that the algorithm cannot finish when the basewidth is too large. Reducing complexity or reducing steps in the algorithm would need to be done to solve the problem, as it seems like the program does not have the capabilty to process higher base widths. \n",

    "Time and space complexity are important because programs should almost always be optimized to reduce time/space complexity. We don't want programs to be unusable\n",

    "The biggest problem with exponential is that the programs quickly fall apart when the inputs become too big. Otherwise, if the inputs are not that large \n",
    "or we have limits on our inputs, an exponential time algorithm would be fine. Sometimes, it might be too hard to optimize our programs, in which case springing for an exponential\n",
