    "\n",
    "1. Colors and background\n",
    "2. appealing images and visuals\n",
    "3. good user input sections\n",
    "4. language and font \n",
    "5. overall professional presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### In your own words, explain what SASS does:\n",
    "- \n",
    "Sass is essentially css but better, allowing us to seamlessly incorporate nice flashy frontend things like themes, different colors, and manipulating images with\n",
    "little fuss. SASS can be easily incorporated with frontend languages like markdown and html. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some benefits to SASS?: \n",
    "-SASS comes with many easy to implement features that make the frontend look much cooler. Animation for one is easy to produce using SASS. Additionally, SASS\n",
    "works with all of the common forms of frontend like html and Markdown, as SASS has similar functionality to CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe/Explain one of the more \"advanced\" SASS properties below in detail:\n",
    "- AN example of an advanced SASS property would be image manipulation, more specifically animating the images and making them move. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can use keyframes in SASS to have an image fade in and out of 2 frames. We could have one image be constantly fading between a different frame\n",
    "we set, or we can use rotation to have an image constantly rotate for something kind of impressive.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the number guesser game work?\n",
    "- In terms of coding and functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "the game uses a simple function, run by a button to check the user's input for what they believe is the answer. The function uses if statements to  compare the user's answer the a randomly selected number (the answer). If the variiables are the same and we are right, a element should change to reflect that we are right, otherwise we use else and else if to tell the user whether or not their guess is too high or too low, changing an element to reflect that. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing?\n",
    "- we could first add some more visually appealing colors to start. Next, we could create some elements for the buttons that look better than the standard ones created. We could also try to incorporate some advanced sass like special images or something like that. just do whatever we would normally do with css."
