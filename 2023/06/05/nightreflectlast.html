<p>My Night At the Museum experience at DNHS!</p>

<p>On May 31st I had the pleasure of experiencing Night at the Museum at Del Norte High school. I got to see a lot of cool arts and crafts made by the many talented art students of DNHS. Its very inspiring to see what amazing arts ordinary students are able to complete with hard work and patience.</p>

<p>this Night at the Museum, I saw a lot more art since I got there a lot earlier than last 2 times. I also played in a band performance at the start, so I had to stay
for a while to be there for the CSP performance later. I got to see a lot of really cool art from the art classes that I missed last time. some of the art there is really
high quality and could honestly be sold for some good money. I also saw a lot of music performances, but I already play music so it wasn’t anything new for me.</p>

<p>As for the actual CSP part, our team got a pretty good video cause we knew a lot of people who would be willing to help out. I can see why lots of connections would be helpful, as it would be hard to get good footage for the video if you didn’t know anyone who would want to help you film. We also didn’t run into any major problems on the day of N@TM that would have broke our project, and everything was ready on the day.</p>

<p>compared to the 1st N@TM, I was a lot more prepared for things, and wasn’t as panicked about the whole thing as the 1st 2 times. I have learned a lot about preparation and creating contingency plans for the worst possible scenarios, in preparation for N@TM. I’m definently a lot better at preparing and presenting Comp Sci work, and will be more than ready for whatever CSA holds in store for me.</p>

<p>our video was also pretty good and showcased everything. I might watch it sometime in the future if I ever want to remember how things were in CSP.</p>
