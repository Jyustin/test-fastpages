<p>my problems in this case were that I skimmed over some minor parts of sections of the CB rubric that caused points to be docked. It’s really important that all parts of the CB rubric are met for each case, as any one thing being skipped means that a point is instantly lost. basically, studying the CB rubric is especially important when 
 writing the written portion out.</p>

<p>It’s not just the explanation that determines if your code will meet the requirements, but the code segemnts themselves also determine how your graded. I mistakingly deducted points for the submission not having any explanations for certain things, but now I see that you could leave a few things out of written explanation if you have it in codebase (but still keep written descriptive)</p>

<p>when doing my CB Performance task, I should make sure to remember to go through the requirements for row 4 and 5 before developing the main function, in order to ensure that I don’t accidentally leave anything out that would cause me to lose points. Losing points on small things looks like a common trend, and I don’t want that to happen to me.</p>

<p>I think that I am doing better on knowing how College Board will grade my performance task. I was tripped up on the last section however, as I wasn’t thorough enough in my grading. When I do my CB performance task, I should refer back to the performance task I graded with full marks and compare mine to theirs, to see if my performance task will get full credit.</p>

<h1 id="final-reflection">FINAL REFLECTION</h1>
<p>although it looks like you could leave out some things from the written part and still get points if you have them in your code, I am going to make sure that my writen sections goes over each requirement of the CBPT rubric to ensure that I know whether or not my performance task will get full credit. additionally, I will need to be sure that I am constantly referring to the rubric when I am coding my task, so that I don’t accidentally leave anything out. I think that the hardest part of this will be making sure I am hitting all of the small requirements, not the actual project itself.</p>
