# helpful advice / notes

tech company mission statements:

HP INC mission statement: "create technology that makes life better for everyone, everywhere"

Qualcomm: inventing tech the world loves

Thermo fisher scientific: Enable our customers to make the world safer and cleaner

Working with others and is a important skill to have in CSP.

Kris porter did research on embedded networked sensors, which introduced him to things like linux and software development life cycle.

From a professional dev ops: dev ops are there to ensure that the release of websites or software are secure and everything works well. 

success in the stem field comes with experience in the field 

Continuous learning 

developed twitter project like datacenter.

different companies have own definition of agile methodology. planning a large roadmap was done at qualcomm before projects.

working "agile" is important in current stem world. 

start looking for other job when companies switch owners and such. 

continuous learning and learning how to learn/ adapt to things is very useful in stem. 

job interviews for tech companies are a massive hurdle to overcome in the stem field.

companies vary from having good workspace to being a "bad" enviorment. enviorments in companies often vary, its usually based on the user.

Don't be concerned about the news 

# final focus / what I learned

from this guest speaker event I learned that working with others and communicating are very important skills in the STEM field to have. 

I also learned that continued learning and constantly pursuing more knowledge of programming and tech is very important to not only succeeding in the STEM workplace but also keeping motivation and drive to work in the STEM field. 

knowing how to "learn" and adapt to problems is another skill that would be helpful to have in computer science.

I also learned that learning problem solving skills and critical thinking skills are a benefit of learning to code that helps out a lot both in the STEM field and in other jobs.

Lastly, I learned that agile methodology and planning are huge parts of projects in Stem and software development that should not be disregarded.
