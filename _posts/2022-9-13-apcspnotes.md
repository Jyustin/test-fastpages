# apcsp week 4 notes 

## collaboration
collaboration helps to take code further

go by yourself if you want to go fast, go with others if you want to go far

pair share code: a pair works together to code. 1 person types in
code, the other person comments on it

leave helpful comments on code to make it easier for others to understand

## computing purpose

Computing innovation Categories
applications, physical devices, systems
SOCIAL MEDIA:allows people to communicate from long distances
ECOMMERICE: allows user to ignore hassle of visiting store or looking for 
specific items

## computing innovations solve problems 


Computing innovations allow us to do what we would have never thought of before, solve problems or pursue interests in creative expression.

program input usually from User

Program input usually effects output. 

programs accept input in different forms:

touch

audio

visual

text

ex: smartphone accepts input from touchscreen, buttons get input from touch, text (entering password)

programs written in event oriented environment 

ex: what type of events can user trigger? think of things like mouse clicks, audio input, etc.

Input usually effects output, but not always. you need to sometimes do specific thing to trigger output

action may trigger event

code segments may be called by certain actions

### program function

A program is only a collection of program statements that do something when run by computer

A code segment is a collection of program statements, so a code segment is part of a program

programs need to work for variety of inputs and situations

A program is a set of statements

A statement is a single command.

A group of statements is called a code segment

## Program design and development

How is program developed?

start with idea

developed with specific purpose in mind

create plan.

sometimes development is exploratory. discovering the new.

developers investigate problem and reflect. investigation is important in development.

determine constraints, user concerns, requirements.

after investigating developers design program

-brainstorm ideas

-plan user experience

How is program developed?

developers decide on program requirements, then use outline to make prototype.

make sure program is tested.

refine and revise program based on reflection

test

### working with others on development

program development is usually team based.

Individuals work on different components. 

MAKE SURE TO CREDIT OTHERS. NAMES MUST BE WRITTEN IN DOCUMENTATION. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IT DUE, EVEN FOR SMALL THINGS.

you can use comments to give credit 

you can also use comment to notify bugs.

using other's code segments is useful in saving time. You can use other's code segments but you have to give credit in documentation.

### questions wrong

I got one question on the first quiz wrong because I misread the question.

I got 2 wrong on the 2nd quiz. It was sometimes hard to understand how sudo code worked and how it would run. The descriptions for the programs were also hard to understand.
