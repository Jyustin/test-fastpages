# submission 1

| my score | AP score | my reasoning                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 1        | program purpose and functionality is described. program functionality is also completely demonstrated in the video.                                                       |
| 1        | 0        | a list is used for the program and it not only has multiple elements but also makes the program more compact/better.                                                      |
| 1        | 0        | the list is explained as managing complexity and the use of the list does help.                                                                                           |
| 0        | 0        | Although the user developed procedure is shown, I don't see how this function is called throughout the entire program nor its overall functionality in the whole program. |
| 0        | 1        | I don't see how sequencing is used in the algorithm and therefore a point cannot be awarded.                                                                              |
| 1        | 1        | the algorithm recieves inputs and the outputs are what is expected. overall  testing is correct and everything is there.                                                  |

# reflection

 my problems in this case were that I skimmed over some minor parts of sections of the CB rubric that caused points to be docked. It's really important that all parts of the CB rubric are met for each case, as any one thing being skipped means that a point is instantly lost. basically, studying the CB rubric is especially important when 
 writing the written portion out.

|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 1        | program functionality is demonstrated in the video. program purpose is described in the written section and input+output is shown. |
| 0        | 1        | an explanation for how the list takes in data and uses it is not present, therefore no point can be awarded.                       |
| 0        | 1        | an explanation for how this list manages complexity and stores data is not present, no point can be awarded.                       |
| 1        | 1        | a student developed procedure with parameters exists and it does contribute to the functionality of the program.                   |
| 1        | 1        | iteration, selection, and sequencing are all used in the procedure and are explained. the procedure is also thoroughly explained.  |
| 0        | 1        | the procedure used is not identified so therefore no point can be awarded.                                                         |

# reflection

It's not just the explanation that determines if your code will meet the requirements, but the code segemnts themselves also determine how your graded. I mistakingly deducted points for the submission not having any explanations for certain things, but now I see that you could leave a few things out of written explanation if you have it in codebase (but still keep written descriptive)
