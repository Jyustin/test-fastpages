# College board Performance task outline

### Materials

I will need to have a Performance task created that hits on all of the marks for the CB Performance task rubric. I will also need to record a video demonstrating program functionality. I also need to create a write up for my performance task that fulfills each of the points on the CB perofmrnace task. 

From the project I will use my own feature for my College Board performance task. this feature I will be taking for use in the performance task will be a program that gives the user a random fact/random word from a list, and allow users to add their own facts to the fact list.
