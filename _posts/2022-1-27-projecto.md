# College board Performance task outline

### Materials

I will need to have a Performance task created that hits on all of the marks for the CB Performance task rubric. I will also need to record a video demonstrating program functionality. I also need to create a write up for my performance task that fulfills each of the points on the CB perofmrnace task. 

From the project I will use my own feature for my College Board performance task. this feature I will be taking for use in the performance task will be a program that gives the user a random fact/random word from a list, and allow users be tested on a random word's definition

### code 

The code will have a main function that creates a random word definition question by pulling from a question list, then it will compare a user's answer to the right answer and either output correct or not correct. 

### video plan

for the video I plan to showcase the page refreshing and giving new facts/words, and then showcase adding a right and wrong answer to my question and showing how it tells you if you are right or wrong.
