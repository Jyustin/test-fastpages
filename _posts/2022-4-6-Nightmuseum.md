# looking at other's projects

Our team spent a lot of time at N@TM trying to scrap together an API to present, so we didn't have much time to view other's projects. I did get a chance to see one teams project though. They were a clock website that would give the user time from certain times zones, as well as a alarm system. I was pretty impressed by their work. They explained to me that their project was a javacript file that drew from a different file with all the information about the timezones. their frontend and backend were well defined, unlike our project, which did not really have defined frontend/backend. 


I also looked at another project with information about stocks. What impressed me the most was the fact that the project was very sleek and professional. Hopefully next time the project I work on will be nice and neat. It really made me feel like the project was something well designed. 


# Reflection 


Overall, I would say this has been a learning experience for me and our team. Our team learned that requirements and a plan should be developed and be completely known. We would have saved ourselves a lot of trouble if we had known that an API would be required beforehand. Additionally, I learned myself that ensuring that I completely understand everything is very important. I learned from watching other people that it pays to be well prepared. Our team was very unprepared for this event, and we were practically scrambling to get everything together. I think that next time we have some sort of deadline, the last 2 days should be testing and ensuring that the product functions, not trying to fit as much into our program as possible.
