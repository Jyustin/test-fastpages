(this little blurb of text is all unimportant stuff you can skip if you want)
First of all, I managed to get to the event right as the presentation was starting, as my band mentoring session was canceled. I admit I was not there exactly at 3:50, in fact I was about 5 minutes late, but the presentators said they were starting right about that time, so I think I got there right as they started. 

# uncategorized notes

Computing and programming is usable in all different types of jobs

Pathways?

Computer science, computer information, cyber security, computer engineering (in terms of computing)

Lots of different STEM pathways a calstste

different professors and their emails were given at this event, I could contact them for help (idk if i will but it is there)

Cool clubs at calstate (robotics club, cybersecurity club, etc.)

# Internships

An internshp is a period of work experence offered by an organizatio

Joining clubs can help you find internships 

Networking is also very helpful to finding internships

check ur emails

look up internship opportunities

AVOID UNPAID INTERNSHIPS 

You can apply even if you feel underqualified. worse thing is rejection

cool summer scholars program to help you be involved in research, also get paid.

Quantum bridge program:

you get to study quantum stuff if ur applied to calstate uni

cool research a Cal state as well

# paying 4 college

grants are money from govt. for you to go to college

You can get loans :/

try to avoid loans

2 different kinds: subsidized loan and unsubsidized loan: 

subsidized reduces interest

unsubsidized puts interest on you right after graduation

# applying for scholarship

Apply for FAFSA, studentaid.gov

Look up "undergraduate scholarship applications"

You can get payed if you pursue masters degree

# conclusion

there was a lot of helpful advice in this presentation about life in college and advice for paying for college, getting internships, etc. 
I do feel like there was more about Cal state than actual helpful advice, but there as definetly some key takeaways from this event. Biggest thing I can
take away from this is that there are a lot of benefits from expanding your circle of connections like increased internship opportunities. Another key takeaway is that
there are a lot of ways for students to reduce the cost of college, however you need to put in some work to reduce your cost of college. Lastly, Calstate, and most likely other colleges, will have different research and internship programs for people to apply for that can have great benefits for students, however you need to find these opportunities through googling, hearing it from people, or just checking email or notifications often.
