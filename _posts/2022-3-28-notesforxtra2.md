(this little blurb of text is all unimportant stuff you can skip if you want)
First of all, I managed to get to the event right as the presentation was starting, as my band mentoring session was canceled. I admit I was not there exactly at 3:50, in fact I was about 5 minutes late, but the presentators said they were starting right about that time, so I think I got there right as they started.
