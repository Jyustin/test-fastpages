| 0        |0         | the program purpose described is just the functionality of the program                                                                       |
| 0        |0         | the purpose of the 2 lists isn't very in depth. there is no description of how this data in the list is used.                                |
| 0        |0         | the explanations are very shallow. also the use of both of the lists is never thoroughly explained. what does the 2nd list do?               |
| 1        |0         | the code segment is talked about and is developed by the student. its functionality and its relation to the overall program is talked about. |
| 0        |0         | I don't think that the algorithm completely utilizes sequencing, selection, and iteration. therefore the point can't be awarded.             |
| 1        |1         | the results from the testing and calls look accurate and nothing repeats nor are unintended results present.                                 |

Reflection
What I learned from grading this submission is that you need to be thorough with your project to ensure that most of the requirements are met. I also realized that 
the performance task I make can be made in outside coding sites like code.org or even scratch I think, so if my ideas are really hard to code or I struggle with syntax,
I could potentially code my project in an ide with simple code blocks. lastly, I thik its important that my performance task has a defined function and reason for existing, so I don't miss the first 2 points.

| 1        | 1        | functionality of the program is shown and it aligns with the purpose of the program, which is good.                                                                                           |
| 1        | 1        | 2 code segments described and the data being stored as well as it's use is described thoroughly.                                                                                              |
| 1        | 1        | the use of the list is described as being integral to the code segment and making it run as well as  possible. solution without list is also plausible.                                       |
| 1        | 1        | a student written procedure as well as it's relation to the entire program is described.  the procedure looks well developed and looks like it has large contribution to the entire codebase. |
| 1        | 1        | the description of the algorithm includes good use of CB vocabulary, and I could easily tell how the procedure works in conjunction with the entire program.                                  |
| 1        | 1        | 2 calls are described and the results of the tests are expected outcomes. the procedure before is  also described.                                                                            |
