# Plan overview

look at CPT written portion and double check everything is up to snuff. Might need to make the project look a little nicer, although im sure that isn't necessary for 6/6 for CPT grading. Biggest concern is missing something small and getting a whole point or so lost, so reviewing rubric and ensuring everything fulfills the categories is the next step I think.

My CPT project should be done when I improve upon my writeup and maybe add some more usage of sequencing, selection, or iteration.

# planned new features

Improving upon the usage of sequencing is something to work towards, as right now the importance of sequencing in my CPT project is debateable. I also think I need to rewrite parts of my written portion, as some feel like they fall short or don't explain the topic as well as it should.
