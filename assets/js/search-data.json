They start at about the 9 minute mark. . Example 1 | Example 2 | . Data Structures. Build a List Comprehension example . list = [calc(item) for item in items] | . HACCCS response . notes from video . Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time . Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations,, some of which are performed simultaneously. . Computers handle a lot of tasks at once . running tasks can be done sequentially, in parallel. . tasks are done one at a time in sequential programming (like conveyor belt) . IN PARALLEL COMPUTING:parallel computing schedules tasks to be executed at same tme parallel computing overall processes data faster and it scales more effectively. . simple Example . Core 1: task A takes 45 ms . Core 2: task B takes 50 ms . Core 3: Task C takes 25 ms; task D takes 30 ms . Core 4: Task E takes 40 ms . Total time: 55 ms (core 3 runs task C and D in sequence) . Basically, 5 tasks are spread out between 4 cores, and all complete tasks at once, finally being done when all cores finish their individual task. . Obviously, if we run all tasks in sequential on 1 core, the time becomes much longer. . Distributive computing: we now distribute our tasks among dfferent computers, not just among 1 physical computer. This needs network connection. Can take longer if network is bad. . Example 1 . A particular computer has 2 identical processors which can run in parallel. Each process must be executed on 1 processor and each processor can only run 1 process at a time. . whats the minimum amount of time (approx) to execute all 3 processes when 2 processor run in paallel? . process X: 50 sec . process Y: 10 sec . process Z: 30 sec . I think this would take 50 seconds, as we can run process X on one processor while the other runs Y and Z. . I WAS RIGHT! . This is a pretty good example for why parallel is good, but how can we develop programs for parallel processing if we don&#39;t have multiple processors to test on? . Example 2 . What is the difference in execution time between runniing the 2 processes in parallel in place of running on single processor? . sequential: 70 seconds . Parallel: 45 seconds . 70 - 45 = 25 seconds . My ans: difference of 25 seconds . I was right . difference of 25 seconds is pretty large and seems unrealistic, but I think it demonstrates why we need to optimize for parallel computing. . list comprehension example .

Using the Pandas python library is neccessary for complex interactions with a premade database or one generated using a dictionary. the pandas library can select and sort through the data for us, like printing out a country with the highest covid deaths at the top of a list of all of the data. Although this library is very useful, I am not sure how I could integrate this with my project, as my project does not use python for anything but has markdown as it&#39;s frontend. . Kaggle is a good source of premade databases for practicing working with databases. the databases also look legit. . database information . the databases I used are crowd-sourced databases from kaggle, meaning that there is likely no biases in the database. This is because there is simply no reason for the developers to try and manipulate the data, as there is no potential gain they could earn from it. However, the database is most likely not up-to-date as steam is a constantly updating marketplace, and prices are constantly being updated and new games are constantly being added. If I wanted to give users information about steam I would use an API, not a database that cannot update itself. . import pandas as pd steamdata = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/games.csv&#39;).sort_values(by=[&#39;user_reviews&#39;], ascending=False) print(&quot;--the top 10 most popular steam games (by user reviews)&quot;) print(steamdata.head(10)) x = steamdata.head(10) y = steamdata z = steamdata.head(100) avg = x[&#39;positive_ratio&#39;].mean() avg2 = y[&#39;price_final&#39;].mean() avg3 = z[&#39;price_final&#39;].mean() print(&quot;the average positive ratio of the top 10 most popular steam games is &quot;,avg, &quot;%&quot;) print(&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;the average cost of a steam game is &quot;, avg2, &quot;usd&quot;) print(&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;the average cost of the top 100 most popular steam games is &quot;, avg3, &quot;usd&quot;) steamdata[&#39;date_release&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(steamdata[&#39;date_release&#39;]) def datasortfunc() : #sort by release date datasort = steamdata.sort_values(by=[&#39;date_release&#39;], ascending=True) print(datasort.head(10)) data2 = datasort[[&#39;title&#39;]].head(10).to_string(index=False) print(&quot;&lt;the 10 earliest games on steam &gt;&quot;) print(data2) datasortfunc() print(&quot;just the title of the top 10 games&quot;) print(steamdata[[&#39;title&#39;]].head(10).to_string(index=False)) . --the top 10 most popular steam games (by user reviews) app_id title date_release win mac 19041 730 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 2012-08-21 True True 19489 578080 PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS 2017-12-21 True False 8746 570 Dota 2 2013-07-09 True True 5347 271590 Grand Theft Auto V 2015-04-13 True False 19473 359550 Tom Clancy&#39;s Rainbow Six® Siege 2015-12-01 True False 9811 440 Team Fortress 2 2007-10-10 True True 7342 105600 Terraria 2011-05-16 True True 2335 4000 Garry&#39;s Mod 2006-11-29 True True 3764 252490 Rust 2018-02-08 True True 7155 292030 The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt 2015-05-18 True False linux rating positive_ratio user_reviews 19041 True Very Positive 88 6941137 19489 False Mixed 57 2142372 8746 True Very Positive 82 1930493 5347 False Very Positive 85 1367837 19473 False Very Positive 87 939992 9811 True Very Positive 93 935635 7342 True Overwhelmingly Positive 97 867226 2335 True Overwhelmingly Positive 96 795170 3764 False Very Positive 87 722973 7155 False Overwhelmingly Positive 96 640996 price_final price_original discount steam_deck 19041 14.99 0.00 0.0 True 19489 0.00 0.00 0.0 True 8746 0.00 0.00 0.0 True 5347 0.00 0.00 0.0 True 19473 19.99 19.99 0.0 True 9811 0.00 0.00 0.0 True 7342 9.99 9.99 0.0 True 2335 9.99 9.99 0.0 True 3764 39.99 39.99 0.0 True 7155 39.99 39.99 0.0 True the average positive ratio of the top 10 most popular steam games is 86.8 % the average cost of a steam game is 8.750796431357113 usd the average cost of the top 100 most popular steam games is 20.706500000000002 usd app_id title date_release win mac linux 16051 282010 Carmageddon Max Pack 1997-06-30 True False False 32559 232770 POSTAL 1997-11-14 True True True 10014 70 Half-Life 1998-11-08 True True True 9364 20 Team Fortress Classic 1999-04-01 True True True 35817 224920 Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1999-09-08 True False False 11214 50 Half-Life: Opposing Force 1999-11-01 True True True 11441 10 Counter-Strike 2000-11-01 True True True 17624 60 Ricochet 2000-11-01 True True True 12938 130 Half-Life: Blue Shift 2001-06-01 True True True 9365 40 Deathmatch Classic 2001-06-01 True True True rating positive_ratio user_reviews price_final 16051 Very Positive 85 428 9.99 32559 Very Positive 85 2329 0.00 10014 Overwhelmingly Positive 96 68327 9.99 9364 Very Positive 85 5146 4.99 35817 Mostly Positive 73 1467 0.00 11214 Overwhelmingly Positive 95 14057 4.99 11441 Overwhelmingly Positive 97 132250 9.99 17624 Very Positive 80 3395 4.99 12938 Very Positive 91 10522 4.99 9365 Mostly Positive 79 1757 4.99 price_original discount steam_deck 16051 9.99 0.0 True 32559 0.00 0.0 True 10014 9.99 0.0 True 9364 4.99 0.0 True 35817 0.00 0.0 True 11214 4.99 0.0 True 11441 9.99 0.0 True 17624 4.99 0.0 True 12938 4.99 0.0 True 9365 4.99 0.0 True &lt;the 10 earliest games on steam &gt;

            "content": "Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . ANS . time and space complexity are important when developing programs, as you don&#39;t want your programs to consume too much memory, or take too long to complete. Basically, managing complexity and time of programs is essential when developing programs for user usage. You don&#39;t want your programs to consume too much of a users memory or take too long basically. . Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . ANS . when comparing time of the algorithm when basewidth is 5000, the algorithm takes 1.4 seconds to complete. . With a basewidth of 40000, the Kernel crashes after 30 seconds or so of the algorithm running. . With a basewidth of 10000, the algorithm takes 5.6 seconds to complete. . basewidth of 625, time is only 0.3 seconds to complete. . This is time problem, as we can see the time of the algorithm becomes longer as the basewidth increases, so reducing steps in the problem to reduce time of the algorithm is something that could potentially be a problem to fix. . This could also be a space complexity, as we can see that the algorithm cannot finish when the basewidth is too large. Reducing complexity or reducing steps in the algorithm would need to be done to solve the problem, as it seems like the program does not have the capabilty to process higher base widths. . Linear time because the program must perform another step when the base width increases, thus linearily increasing timeoftfhefucntion. . Written Hacks . research on types of sorting algorithms and complexity . Constant:O(1). this is very good, as our time is guarunteed to stay low. Linear time: O(n). not as good as Constant, but better than other methods, as we are only increasing in steps by a set amount. . Logarithmic time: O( log n) not very good as O(1) and O(n), but can be useful. time grows logaritmicly. . Quadratic time: O(n^2). time is now increasing exponentially, which isn&#39;t good at all, but its not as bad as O(2^n) . Exponential time: O(2^n). very bad, steps become out of control at some values . Q: Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . Time and space complexity are important because programs should almost always be optimized to reduce time/space complexity. We don&#39;t want programs to be unusable because they take up too much time or use up too much of a user&#39;s cpu/memory. . Q: Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . Constant time algorithms shouldn&#39;t always be used, as sometimes we need to use an exponential time algorithm for our programs. However, you should strive to have constant time algorithms or the shortest possible time algorithm, so that a user&#39;s experience isn&#39;t bogged down by long downtime as the program runs. The biggest problem with exponential is that the programs quickly fall apart when the inputs become too big. Otherwise, if the inputs are not that large or we have limits on our inputs, an exponential time algorithm would be fine. Sometimes, it might be too hard to optimize our programs, in which case springing for an exponential time algorithm would be neccessary, but reducing time should be something to keep in mind when developing programs. . Q: What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . NOTICE:When your calculation is not dependent on the input size, it is a constant time complexity . NOTICE:When you have a single loop within your algorithm, it is linear time complexity . NOTICE: When the input size is reduced by half, maybe when iterating, handling recursion, or whatsoever, it is a logarithmic time complexity . NOTICE: When you have nested loops within your algorithm, meaning a loop in a loop, it is quadratic time complexity . NOTICE: When the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input, it is exponential time complexity .",

This is our blog for code.org 3 question quiz. fruit quiz 4 different choices, 1 correct answer, for each question. getting a correct answer will play a nice sound if a question is wrong you will be brought to a screen that tells you that your wrong, and can move on to the next question. At the end of the quiz will be 2 buttons. one writes the player&#39;s score, and the other allows the player to retake the quiz. fruit image at the start image corresponding with each choice display score at the end question 1: what color is an apple? answer: red wrong: orange wrong: blue wrong: purple question 2: when were bananas discovered? answer: 327 BC wrong: 1999 wrong: 1782 wrong: 2020 BC question 3: which one is not a fruit? answer: mushroom wrong: tomato wrong: melon wrong: strawberry struggles: adding the ability to see score at the end of the quiz was challenging, as we hadn&#39;t worked with javascript before and were confused by what to do, but eventually got it with a variable that adds onto itself each time the correct answer is selected. Working with code.org sometimes felt frustrating, as it was sometimes slower to use blocks than to type out code, but it is useful for learning javascript, as it gives us everything we need to start with. no need to look up things. . what . onEvent(&quot;button1&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function() { setScreen(&quot;screen2&quot;); }); var x = 0; onEvent(&quot;button3&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { x = x+1; setScreen(&quot;screen4&quot;); playSound(&quot;sound://category_achievements/lighthearted_bonus_objective_1.mp3&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button4&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen3&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button2&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen3&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button5&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen3&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button13&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen6&quot;); playSound(&quot;sound://category_achievements/peaceful_win_8.mp3&quot;); x = x+1; }); onEvent(&quot;button7&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen5&quot;); playSound(&quot;sound://category_achievements/lighthearted_bonus_objective_1.mp3&quot;); x = x+1; }); onEvent(&quot;button6&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen4&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button15&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen5&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button10&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen7&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button16&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen5&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button12&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen8&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button14&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen8&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button11&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen8&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button16&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen6&quot;); playSound(&quot;sound://category_achievements/peaceful_win_2.mp3&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button17&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { write(&quot;you got &quot; + (x + &quot; right&quot;)); }); onEvent(&quot;button9&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen7&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;button8&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen7&quot;); }); onEvent(&quot;retake&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function( ) { setScreen(&quot;screen1&quot;); }); .",

Modularity: the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program . HINT: procedures should be descriptive. also consider what parameters to set and what data is needed for the procedure . Note: There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements. also remember to keep procedures simple. . make sure to have multiple different functions in a procedure . Think of procedures like functions I guess? . hacks for 3.12 . Q 1: . a -- ? b -- ? c -- 9 PROCEDURE find a () { b &lt;-- 9 9 . a &lt;-- b c . Print (a) } What is a? . ANS: a would become 891 since the procedure puts b as 99 then sets a to be b*c which is 891 (i may be wrong) . Q 2: . cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10% PROCEDURE applytax (cost, cpercentDiscounted){ temp &lt;-- 100 + percentTaxed temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost)} . What is the cost? . ANS: temp = 110/100 so cost = 173 * 1.1 = 190.3 so cost = 190.3 . 3.13 Homework/Hacks . Q 1: Create a procedure that is meant to replace the top running backs yards per game in one season if the current running back has more yards per game . Necessary Parameters: toprbyardspg(100), currentrbyards(1260), totalGames(12) . ANS below . toprbyardspg = 100 currentrbyards = 1260 totalGames = 12 procedure topyards(toprbyardspg, currentrbyards, totalGames) { currentrbyards = 1260 / totalGames if toprbyardspg &lt; currentrbyards: currentrbyards = toprbyardspg } . 2. Write a procedure that will allow the A+ to get to the 1, while avoiding the black boxes. . Use what you learned about moving robots .

Q 3: . Which Is the Correct Way to define the Name of a Procedure? . A. PROCEDURE MYLIST . B. PROCEDURE MyList . C. procedure mylist . ANS: B because procedure is in caps and it&#39;s camel cased. . Q 4: . Write A Procedure That gets the BeachBall To the Green Square . PROCEDURE toEnd() { move_forward() rotate_left() move_forward() rotate_right() move_forward() move_forward() move_forward() move_forward() move_forward() rotate_left() move_forward() move_forward() } . missing hacks (oops) . Problem 1: This problem involves parameters Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed= . Total Time/Total Distance​ . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } This is the correct equation, the others have the wrong equation or don&#39;t add the extra variables needed. . Problem 2: Procedures with return values . James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, &quot;!!!&quot;) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . True because there is nothing displaying the text . False . Problem 3: Procedures with return values Bubz is writing a program to calculate the carbon footprint of his activities. The procedure calcFlightFootprint calculates the pounds of carbon dioxide produced per passenger in a flight that covers a given number of miles and seats a given number of passengers. . PROCEDURE calcFlightFootprint(numMiles, numPassengers) { CO2_PER_MILE ← 53.29 . carbonPerFlight ← numMiles * CO2_PER_MILE . carbonPerPassenger ← carbonPerFlight / numPassengers . RETURN carbonPerPassenger . } . Bubz wants to use that procedure to calculate the total footprint for his two upcoming flights: LA to NY: 2,451 miles and 118 passengers NY to London: 3,442 miles and 252 passengers . Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers. . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) this is adding the 2 flights co2 production seperately . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252) . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252)) this is summing up the passengers and miles and then calculating the total flight footprint . laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon .",

Sass is essentially css but better, allowing us to seamlessly incorporate nice flashy frontend things like themes, different colors, and manipulating images with little fuss. SASS can be easily incorporated with frontend languages like markdown and html. | . What are some benefits to SASS?: . -SASS comes with many easy to implement features that make the frontend look much cooler. Animation for one is easy to produce using SASS. Additionally, SASS works with all of the common forms of frontend like html and Markdown, as SASS has similar functionality to CSS. . Describe/Explain one of the more &quot;advanced&quot; SASS properties below in detail: . AN example of an advanced SASS property would be image manipulation, more specifically animating the images and making them move. | . For example, you can use keyframes in SASS to have an image fade in and out of 2 frames.

Link to Number Guesser Game . How does the number guesser game work? . In terms of coding and functions: | . the game uses a simple function, run by a button to check the user&#39;s input for what they believe is the answer. The function uses if statements to compare the user&#39;s answer the a randomly selected number (the answer). If the variiables are the same and we are right, a element should change to reflect that we are right, otherwise we use else and else if to tell the user whether or not their guess is too high or too low, changing an element to reflect that. . Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing? . we could first add some more visually appealing colors to start. Next, we could create some elements for the buttons that look better than the standard ones created.

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a __dictionary_. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is __O(1)_. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # THE output of the function is {1,2,3}. # There are no duplicate values # probably b/c we can&#39;t have duplciates in hashes. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Sets are a good example of how collisions in hashing works and why we shouldn&#39;t have duplicate # Sets are a tool we can use for hashing if we don&#39;t want to use dictionaries. . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . ANS . time and space complexity are important when developing programs, as you don&#39;t want your programs to consume too much memory, or take too long to complete. Basically, managing complexity and time of programs is essential when developing programs for user usage. You don&#39;t want your programs to consume too much of a users memory or take too long basically. . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . ANS . when comparing time of the algorithm when basewidth is 5000, the algorithm takes 1.4 seconds to complete. . With a basewidth of 40000, the Kernel crashes after 30 seconds or so of the algorithm running. . With a basewidth of 10000, the algorithm takes 5.6 seconds to complete. . basewidth of 625, time is only 0.3 seconds to complete. . This is time problem, as we can see the time of the algorithm becomes longer as the basewidth increases, so reducing steps in the problem to reduce time of the algorithm is something that could potentially be a problem to fix. . This could also be a space complexity, as we can see that the algorithm cannot finish when the basewidth is too large. Reducing complexity or reducing steps in the algorithm would need to be done to solve the problem, as it seems like the program does not have the capabilty to process higher base widths. .

Time: 0.1 seconds . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . time: 0.1 seconds . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . time: 0.1 seconds . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . time: 0.3 seconds . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

seconds . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . time: over a minute, did not even complete . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . time: 0.1 seconds . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . time: 0.1 seconds . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . fibonacci with 30: 0.4 seconds . fibonacci with 40: 34.6 seconds . fibonacci with 20: 0.1 seconds . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets #print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])) .

Explain? | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Written Hacks . research on types of sorting algorithms and complexity . Constant: O(1). this is very good, as our time is guarunteed to stay low. . Linear time: O(n). not as good as Constant, but better than other methods, as we are only increasing in steps by a set amount. . Logarithmic time: O( log n) not very good as O(1) and O(n), but can be useful. time grows logaritmicly. . Quadratic time: O(n^2). time is now increasing exponentially, which isn&#39;t good at all, but its not as bad as O(2^n) . Exponential time: O(2^n). very bad, steps become out of control at some values . Q: Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . Time and space complexity are important because programs should almost always be optimized to reduce time/space complexity. We don&#39;t want programs to be unusable because they take up too much time or use up too much of a user&#39;s cpu/memory. . Q: Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . Constant time algorithms shouldn&#39;t always be used, as sometimes we need to use an exponential time algorithm for our programs. However, you should strive to have constant time algorithms or the shortest possible time algorithm, so that a user&#39;s experience isn&#39;t bogged down by long downtime as the program runs. The biggest problem with exponential is that the programs quickly fall apart when the inputs become too big. Otherwise, if the inputs are not that large or we have limits on our inputs, an exponential time algorithm would be fine. Sometimes, it might be too hard to optimize our programs, in which case springing for an exponential time algorithm would be neccessary, but reducing time should be something to keep in mind when developing programs. . Q: What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . NOTICE:When your calculation is not dependent on the input size, it is a constant time complexity . NOTICE:When you have a single loop within your algorithm, it is linear time complexity . NOTICE: When the input size is reduced by half, maybe when iterating, handling recursion, or whatsoever, it is a logarithmic time complexity . NOTICE: When you have nested loops within your algorithm, meaning a loop in a loop, it is quadratic time complexity . NOTICE: When the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input, it is exponential time complexity .",

What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? | What are the Data Types in SQL table? | . ans . A database schema is how the database is structured and defines how all of the data in the database is organized, like defining the columns in the database for ease of access. . An identity column would be used for values that can be used to identify a object in the database. . a primary key is an identifier of a unit in the database, like user id/login info . some data types include integers, strings, booleans, basically any types can be in a table. . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection def create_table(conn, create_table_sql): &quot;&quot;&quot; create a table from the create_table_sql statement :param conn: Connection object :param create_table_sql: a CREATE TABLE statement :return: &quot;&quot;&quot; c = conn.cursor() c.execute(create_table_sql) sql_create_comments_table = &quot;&quot;&quot; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects ( _uid integer PRIMARY KEY, _name text NOT NULL ); &quot;&quot;&quot; create_table(conn, sql_create_comments_table) conn.commit() .

What attributes are in the object? | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? | . ans . a connection object would a way for user or program to connect to database . the cursor object is used to making specific connections to the database to do things like delete users. . It looks like the cursor has special functions for doing specific tasks. Cursor has functions like &quot;fetch all&quot; in its function variables . the conn object looks like the object that enables program to database connection. Conn has functions like &quot;backup&quot; in its function variables. . Results is also an object it has things in it like data in this case. . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . ans . this create uses conn as method to connect to database and cursor to interact with it. the other create uses objects to store the user while it is being made, and uses a seperate user class to create those user objects. the 2nd implementation is a lot mroe longer and looks harder to read, while this one is more compact. However, the use of oop in the 4a example could have its uses. The 2nd might be better in long term as using objects for storing users may make troubleshooting easier in the future. . SQL Insert is different in that it is used to add new things into our database, and is purely for that purpose, while user init is used to initialize the entire database and all of it&#39;s objects, and is therefore much more important. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . A new user record has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . ans . the hacked part makes it so that the user&#39;s password becomes a different one if they set it to be too short, probably to ensure users set protective passwords. . the try and except is used so that one thing occurs, except for when another thing would happen. the except occurs when theres an error with executing sqlite commands or accessing the database. . the conn and cursor are repeated each time, probably because these are neccessary for each function to operate. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . ans . Delete could potentially be dangerous as without a verification system for it, users could accidentally delete others accounts. . I think that the f allows us to print the {uid} in the print, and the {uid} is used to allow us to print the uid the users inputted, although im not entirely sure. . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . ans . the menu repeats because the end of the conditional statement causes the statement to run again. it does break when the program detects a certain input. . the menu could be refactored with a list maybe, if we used key-value pairs, but we would still have to use if statements. a for loop might work as well however. . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) .

DATA ABSTRACTION EXAMPLE WITH DEBUGGING IN 2.4b . . when debugging the first code block in this file, we can see an example of data abstraction in the conn variable. This conn variable does data abstraction by storing a bunch of different functions in it for the user to use. this is seen in the 2nd image, when we create a cursor object by using the cursor method of conn. this data abstraction is occuring in that conn hides a bunch of important methods and functions from the programmer/user, so that the user can use the methods in sqlite without having a bunch of different methods to sort through. . score .",

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Here are some Images Files. Download these files, load them into images directory under _notebooks in your Blog. - Clouds Impression . Lassen Volcano | Green Square | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab | Size, height and width, number of pixels | Visual perception, lossy compression | . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . Introduction to displaying images in Jupyter notebook . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? | What are some of the major differences? | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;online&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;smile face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smileyforpts.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . NOTES for above code . this code works using libraries to pull images from our folder with all of our images and display them using built in procedures from the libraries we import. The path of the images is important because without the defined path, our program does not know where to pull these images from. . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | How do these effects apply to images? | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. .

Notes 2 . this code uses functions built using the libraries shown earlier to modify the images above, instad of just displaying them. For example, the scale_image function is used to scale up the images and scales it up/down depending on the value was set. If I wanted to use these libraries I would probably look at documentation, but that takes time, and I don&#39;t think that will help me on the CB test. . Data Structures and OOP . Most data structures classes require Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Since this class is lined up with a College Course, OOP will be talked about often. Functionality in remainder of this Blog is the same as the prior implementation. Highlight some of the key difference you see between imperative and oop styles. .

            "content": "score . . question 1 . . I got this problem wrong because I didn’t consider that although malicious links can be posted to the database, the system doesn’t really interact with these links to be harmed by them. the more realistic answer that could reasonably happen would be unauthorized access to the database, which is more realistic and makes sense. I just didn’ think this one through enough. . question 2 . . I got this problem wrong because I assumed that a database would ensure that information is more secure, but really that is up to the level of cybersecurity that is given to this database. The answer that makes more sense is the 1st one about helping the company to ensure they make the right decisions, because that one is guarunteed by the database, and is not a theoretical benefit from having databases. . question 3 . . With this problem, I simply rushed through it and didn’t think it through. removing the last 4 instead of the last 2 characters makes sense, as we want the letters between the characters between the removed first 2 and last 2 characters. I guess I didn’t think this through enough and just picked 2 because it looked like it made more sense than removing 4 characters from the end. . question 4 . . For this problem, I think that what I did was I didn’t take the time to compare option C and D and see why these were different. I think I picked C because I missed the NOT part after the motion sensor check. If I had just looked at all of the options thoroughly and thought about why C was better than the other options, I may have noticed the not part and then known that D was the answer I was really after. . question 5 . . I got this one wrong because I didn’t consider all of the possibilities for when submitting values into the algorithm. I guess sudo-code reading is still something I could work on, although I still need to mentally think about each possible input when reading these algorithms, which takes a while. I think I just need to work on mentally considering all possibilitys of an algorithm or which scenarios in which an algorithm fails. . question 6 . . I for some reason thought that the if statement would be fulfilled when running through the algorithm in my head. It should be 3 because the if statement goes into the else and then because y is greater than 3, three is displayed. I guess I need to be more careful when I’m reading sudo code and testing inputs in my head. . question 7 . . I got this one wrong because I only considered the raw number of steps being taken, when I should have also taken into consideration how the steps for each algorithm are increasing. then, I would have seen how algorithm B would dramatically increase in steps. I was just not thinking about this problem enough. . final reflection . I think that the biggest problem for me is that I either skim over questions and miss important details, or I spend too much time testing each possible value on certain problems when the answer shouldn’t be that hard to find. More experience doing practice problems and tests would probably help me get better at quickly reading sudo code, then seeing where errors lie, and then picking the right answer, because those are the most time consuming problems I have right now. .",

Might need to make the project look a little nicer, although im sure that isn’t necessary for 6/6 for CPT grading.

My CPT project should be done when I improve upon my writeup and maybe add some more usage of sequencing, selection, or iteration. . planned new features . Improving upon the usage of sequencing is something to work towards, as right now the importance of sequencing in my CPT project is debateable.

            "content": "5.1 questions . 1: Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . Computing has created many powerful advancements in technology that would have been impossible without computing. The Worldwide Web and email are just 2 different developments only possible by computing that have completely changed our lives. however, theses new developments come with positives and negatives. The worldwide web, while being able to spread information and make knowledge more accessible, also puts this same info in the hands of anyone who would use this information for immoral tasks. Drones can be used for entertainment or to take breathtaking picutres, or could be used for warfare or invasions of privacy. Videogames can create unforgettable experiences and bring people from different parts of the world together, but can also become an obsession or cause a divide between reality and virtual world. basically not all developments are completely black and white. . 2: Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine and getting it from phones and games can definetly spiral into a problem without any self control. People can definetly become addicted to getting dopamine from social media/games and spend way more time on these things than they really should. I know because I have sometimes found myself being too immersed in a game and forgetting that I have a life outside of it. But i haven’t let it become a huge problem. . 5.2 questions . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . My ANS: You can empower yourself in a digital world by using knowledge found from the internet to help you make informed decisions or to inform you on current world problems so that you can discuss them. You could also empower yourself by finding other people who share your beliefs or hobbies and learning from them. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . My ANS: people who are empowered can help others who are not empowered by giving them confidence in themselves and showing them that there is some truth to whatever ideas or decisions they made or want to make. I can empower people at DNHS by giving compliments or showing people that I care about their endeavors and that whatever they have accomplished is impressive or meaningful. I know I would feel more empowered in my COMP SCI class if i was reaffirmed that the work I made is high quality or is teaching me something beneficial. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . My ANS: I believe that paper is only a minor block to digital empowerment as there aren’t many differences between using paper or a computer for doing work. However I think that “red tape” and an excessive desire to control and regulate technology by the school is heavily interferring with empowerment at DNHS and learning via technology as a whole at this school. The schools’s firewall is incredibly opressive and could be compared to chinese censorship with the amount of banning and problems it has caused. Educational content or even stuff in comp sci like accessing AWS last tri were blocked by the firewall last year, and I feel like it heavily impacted the potental for digital empowerment at DNHS. In general, censorship by governments is the biggest roadblock to digital empowerment, as it prevents certain people from metting others and getting empowered from people online. . extra questions 1 . Q 1: Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit: . ANS: One of the benefits of our news project is that users will be able to get reliable and unbiased news if we are able to implement a filter for biased news. This would be helpful for people who want to filter out the opinions in news and get the straight facts. . Another benefit will be that users will be able to gain some neat information they might want through the use of the sports feature or the educational feature, which differs from traditional news sites which give primarily news and not much else. . Lastly, our project will be able to provide credible news sites to users if we are able to implement the filter feature, since getting reliable news is becoming more and more difficult by the day. . Q 2: Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . ANS: One harmful effect of our project could be that we may end up accidentally spreading harmful or biased news on our site if our algorithm for filtering news is not completely working, which would tarnish our reputation and would be misinforming users. . Q 3: Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . ANS: Internet blockers at school only serve to prevent students from abusing the internet and using it to look up bad content. Even this is a problem because the blockers usually are unreliable and will block sites that have no reason to be blocked. Another con of the blocker is that it installs certain addons on chrome when students log into chrome on their laptop through their school accounts. These addons, while being able to filter out more bad content, are also an intrusion of privacy and i’m sure it’s only a matter of time before they are hacked and all of our data is stolen. Lastly, im sure that they cause the wifi to be unreliable, as I am constantly disconnecting from school wifi, yet I never randomly disconnect from other wifis. I hope that you (the teachers) will hopefully find a way to convince the school to either remove the blockers or invest more money in a better I.T department. . Q 4: What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . ANS: I am mainly concerned about the digital divide for others, and how it makes it so that those who can’t get their hands on good tech will be disadvantaged. Without a laptop, I find it hard to believe that any student could have the potential to succeed or have nearly as much potential as those who did have access to those resources. Hopefully providing tech to those who need it will become more of a priority, as a laptop in the right hands could bring people out of poverty. . 5.3 Computing Bias questions . My thoughts: . I think that most bias generated by Computing and algorithms are made unintentionally or for profit. in the profit instance, the bias are made so that users will be swayed to purchase or give money to a company. These biases are made through the use of targeted ads and skewing results to user information. These “for profit” biases made through algorithms cause people to use their money on things that they really don’t need to spend money on, but are mostly harmless. . unintentional bias can be generated by computing/algorithms when these algorithms cause people’s feeds of information and how their getting their info to become skewed to a side. An example of this would be youtube giving users conservative-sided videos when those users become interested in that side, causing that user to be only exposed to that political side and them to not be given videos that are actually true. . I think that the best way to avoid biases in our project will be to ensure that we have filters for our news that are thoroughly tested and are well equipped to block out biased news, seeing that our project would have nothing special about it if it was a biased news site like every other news site. We could also make sure that our news site brings in news from all different viewpoints to ensure that this project isn’t unintentionally being skewed to a certain side/viewpoint. . 5.4 Computing Bias questions . 1.CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . ANS: A crowdsource idea that I might be able to initiate for this enviorment could be a simple site that allows Comp Sci students to give their opinions on the course and basically help the teachers improve the curiccullum. This could be done using a site that allows users to submit reviews of the Comp Sci course to this site, and then the teachers can view this info later to improve the curriculum. . 2.What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . ANS: Implementing crowdsourcing in Del Norte could be done through volunteering or with an easily accessible site. My idea is to have a club that starts projects that people can join and contribute to, perhaps for example, a project to add a chalkboard to a wall in the school could be started, and then crowdsourced to students so that they can contribute to the creation of this project. Our Project can be better with crowdsourcing if we crowdsource our news database to users and allow users to add credible news to the site, as a way to basically keep the news feed fresh. Crowdsourcing the news feed would also ensure that our news feed would have a variety of news from many different people’s perspectives. However, It would be hard to moderate this and ensure that no one desiced to add bad news to our . 3.What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . ANS: I already stated an idea for crowdsourcing earlier but I could create another page on our project that would allow visitors of our project to log reviews of our project. That way, we can get feedback from users and see what we need to work on in our Comp Sci skillset. Capturing user feedback and their experience with our project would be interesting to see as we would be able to see the appeal of our project to regular people who have lives, and we would be able to know how much use our project would have in the real world. . 5.5 Legal and Ethical concerns questions/notes . -each different license of a program or work wil determine how others can use the work and whether or not you can use it without citing an author or paying something up. . The following are all OPEN SOURCE licenses: . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license ensures that the work is in public domain and anyone can use it . Open Source MIT License allows the code you have made to be used by others, including allowing people to distribute closed source versions. of closed source versions. you may need to cite author though. . Open Source GPL License ensures people can do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . Open source licenses ensure that when users want to open up their projects to the public, their works are worked with exactly how the author intends. Although this license stuff isn’t too applicable to what we are working with now, it certainly is applicable to companies or for profit buisnesses who may be breaking open source licenses. . For my personal blog, I would use an Open Source MIT License. This is because I want people to be able to use my blogs and code to help themselves, but I also want to be credited so that I can build myself a reputation. I want the credit for my work so that people don’t steal my works and claim it as theirs. Hopefully people will use my blog as a guide or something and I can be credited for making the works. . For the entire team repository, I think that a MIT license would be good because I am ok with others taking our frontend and using how they want with credit to us. It doesn’t matter much if they are copying our project as the code we are putting on frontend isn’t really too valuable. On the other hand, the Backend code should be under the Open Source GPL License, because I think our backend code has more value and I don’t really want people to copy and redistribute our backend code. . 5.6 Safe Computing questions . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. | In our project, user usernames and emails used to sign up would be PII that would be known by everyone, and not to secretive. On the other hand, password would be PII that we would need to keep absolutely secret, as other people should not be able to log into another person’s account. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? | I feel like PII should be handled carefully online and that you should keep as little PII on the internet as possible. the more PII you have on the internet shared with others, the easier it is for people to use that information for malicious stuff. You could be targeted by scams or spam if you have thrown out too much PII online. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. | A good password would be something with variety and is hard for the average person to determine. Something like I8#FoUrL0ive would be very hard for someone to just type in and hope to work. technology used to crack passwords would also struggle with this. Something like 12345 or abcde would be a stupid password as it has no variety and any AI could solve for this password in a few seconds. A step that is used to assist in authenticaton is 2-factor Authentication, which ensures that even if someone cracked the password, it will still be hard to log in. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. | Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where only a single key would be used for encryption and decryption of data like passwords. . With Asymmetric encryption, there are 2 keys used for encryption of decryption. Theres a public key, probably for other people to use, and private key that would need to be used in combination with the public key probably for access to the account. (Not to sure about this) . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. | If I remember, our teams had some kind of encryption key included in our AWS deployment. Our security keys and important things in our AWS deployment were kept encrpyted, and I think that we got a key that we would use to decrpyt the data. so we had a key for encryption and decryption. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. | I have never been scammed out of money/information by Phishing scams, but I may have come close. I saw an offer on offerup that was clearly too good to be true, but I kind of fell for it and entered a chat with them in texts where I was asked for a paypal payment. I instantly knew it was a scam afterwards and blocked all contact with them. I also know that I have seen scams like “you have won a phone” or something, but I am smarter now and know that if it is too good to be true, it is. .",

It’s not just the explanation that determines if your code will meet the requirements, but the code segemnts themselves also determine how your graded.

FINAL REFLECTION . although it looks like you could leave out some things from the written part and still get points if you have them in your code, I am going to make sure that my writen sections goes over each requirement of the CBPT rubric to ensure that I know whether or not my performance task will get full credit. additionally, I will need to be sure that I am constantly referring to the rubric when I am coding my task, so that I don’t accidentally leave anything out. I think that the hardest part of this will be making sure I am hitting all of the small requirements, not the actual project itself. .",

Reflection . What I learned from grading this submission is that you need to be thorough with your project to ensure that most of the requirements are met. I also realized that the performance task I make can be made in outside coding sites like code.org or even scratch I think, so if my ideas are really hard to code or I struggle with syntax, I could potentially code my project in an ide with simple code blocks. lastly, I thik its important that my performance task has a defined function and reason for existing, so I don’t miss the first 2 points. . submission 2 . my score AP score my reasoning . 1 | 1 | functionality of the program is shown and it aligns with the purpose of the program, which is good. | . 1 | 1 | 2 code segments described and the data being stored as well as it’s use is described thoroughly. | . 1 | 1 | the use of the list is described as being integral to the code segment and making it run as well as possible. solution without list is also plausible. | . 1 | 1 | a student written procedure as well as it’s relation to the entire program is described. the procedure looks well developed and looks like it has large contribution to the entire codebase. | . 1 | 1 | the description of the algorithm includes good use of CB vocabulary, and I could easily tell how the procedure works in conjunction with the entire program. | . 1 | 1 | 2 calls are described and the results of the tests are expected outcomes. the procedure before is also described. | . reflection . For my performance task, I should make sure that the algorithm I make is entirely student developed and that I completely understand how it functions, otherwise I will lose points for not completely describing the algorithm I make and how I describe it.

What I learned is that program purpose is especially important and that getting program function and program purpose is a mistake that someone could easily make. . program functionality “is The behavior of a program during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it” . program purpose is “The problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program” . college board vocab is vital to this!!!!! . submission 4 . my score AP score my reasoning . 1 | 1 | program functionality and purpose are described but are kind of hard to tell. user input and output + program functionality are described. | . 1 | 0 | the solution for not having lists feels a little cheap, but technically the list does have purpose and the list does assist with the overall program. | . 1 | 0 | the use of a list is relevant and is described. also an explanation for how the list works with the entire program is also described. | . 0 | 1 | the specific algorithm/procedure is talked about and its overall relation to the entire program is described, but I don’t think any specific parameters are mentioned. | . 1 | 1 | the way the algorithm works is described enough so I could build it myself, and the use of selection/iteration is mentioned | . 0 | 0 | the testing does not mention any algorithms that test the users input. it isn’t up to standard. needs to mention how it works. | . reflection . I think that I didn’t pay enough attention to all of the details of the submission and how they fit into the overall rubric. I should remember to specify how the inputs im putting into the program during testing work with the algorithm, to ensure that I don’t lose points on simply testing the program. . overall reflection . I think that I was a little too leniant on my grading and didn’t notice obvious point deductions. In order to avoid not being docked points for my Performance task, I will remember to double check that my work fits college board criteria, as well as review and use college board vocab to ensure that my written portion is thorough enough to get enough points. . My program will need a list with multiple elements that uses data for certain things and manages complexity a well defined function and purpose, an algorithm that plays an integral role in the program’s function and uses iteration, sequencing, and selection, and well defined user inputs and outputs. .",

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

HINT: libraries can simplify complex problems and using them can make a problem easier to solve . APIs (application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave and be utilized. . Documentation is an explanation of the code . HINT: look at Documentation for code if you don&#39;t understand something . The APCSP EXAM REFRENCE SHEET could come in handy later. it is essentially a library provided by College Board. . you may need expressions for generating random values. . EX: random number generator, dice roll, etc. . RANDOM(a, b) generates and returns a random integer from a to b, inclusive. Each result is equally likely to occur. . randint(start, stop) generates random integer between start and stop. . randrange(start, stop, step) generates random number where start is min value, stop is max value, and step is the multiples the rng generates. . If start = 0 and step = 5 all the values that can by outputed are 0 and multiples of 5 . HACKS . reflection . libraries and APIs are essentially prewritten code that can help you on complex problems. These libraries and APIs can also be used to not only write code easier and not develop everything on projects but also be the entire foundation of the code itself. I also learned to use documentation to understand code segments and libraries/APIS. Documentation should be looked at before using a library or tinkering with some code, as it gives you an understanding of the code you are working with and how you could work with it. lastly, understand that random expressions and the use of random algorithms will be tested on the AP EXAM. It is especially important to understand the random syntax for pseudocode on the AP Exam because there will definetly be problems on the exam with different random expressions. . multiple choice . Q 1: What does the random(a,b) function generate? . A. A random integer from a to be exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . ANS: B. this is the definition given earlier and makes most sense . Q 2: What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? . A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . ANS: A, because x and y determine min and max values, and z is supposed to determine the steps the random values take . Q 3: Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? . A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . ANS: A because random.item sounds like it is just random.choice, which does exists. it is logical to believe that random.item can&#39;t exist because a similar existing random function already exists that could probably do what that intended to do. . Q 3: What is the advantage of using libraries? . Using libraries can make your projects and code much more simpler and take less time to write, as libraries essentially provide you with prewritten code that you can build upon for projects or use for their algorithms to avoid writing your own algorithms/code for everything. basically, libraries make writing code more efficient, as they give you prewritten algorithms that you can use for your code. Even if you want to write everything yourself, its important to know that libraries also reduce the size of your code, as it means you don&#39;t need to write a bunch of code that you could easily replicate using a library. .

How to convert binary to numbers . binary works in that each number has a decimal value, and that number will add onto the full value. for example. to find the value of 1011, you would convert 1 to 2^3, 0 to 0, 1 to 2^1, and the last 1 to 2^0. the power the 2s goes to is determined by the place it is in the binary. . 1 0 1 1 . 1 would be 4ths place . 0 would be 3rd place if 1 was there . 1 would be 2nd place . and last 1 would be 0 place . then we add all of the values together, which would add up to 8 + 2 + 1 which is 11. . I only got this problem wrong because I had no idea how binary numbers worked, but now, I am sure that I will get problems like this right next time. . problem 2 . . My problem here was that i mistakenly gave p its original value the fifth statement, p &lt;— q makes p equal q, which is 20. . last statement setting r equal to p should have been 20 because p had been initialized to 20 earlier, but I must have glossed over the 5th statement and read through the code too quickly, because I thought that p was still it’s original value, 10. Next time, I need to make sure that I completely read through pseudo code problems like this many times over to confirm that I understand the entirety of the problem. . problem 3 . . my error here was that I was thinking about this too hard and trying to work out what happens at each runthrough of the loop. I should have looked at things from a math perspective and realized what the loop was essentially doing, not what is happening at each playthrough of the loop. . basically, this problem is adding x to itself 5 times. so the first time, x is 1, which then adds 2 to that 1, and so on until x is 5. My mistake was that I was thinking too hard about it, and stopped at the 4th runthrough of the loop. I forgot to add that last five. I think that I will need to work on understanding for loops more and math functions in general so that I don’t slip up like this again . reflection . I feel like I am doing pretty good in my knowledge of pseudo code and networking, as I did well on those problems. the hard ones that gave me a challenge were the ones that I did not understand, like the binary problems. I think that to do better on the next test, I need to think critically and slowly read through the problem to ensure I know exactly how the problem will be run through. But for now, I think i am doing pretty well. .",

I did get a chance to see one teams project though. They were a clock website that would give the user time from certain times zones, as well as a alarm system. I was pretty impressed by their work. They explained to me that their project was a javascript file that drew from a different file with all the information about the timezones. their frontend and backend were well defined, unlike our project, which did not really have defined frontend/backend. . I also looked at another project with information about stocks. What impressed me the most was the fact that the project was very sleek and professional. Hopefully next time the project I work on will be nice and neat. It really made me feel like the project was something well designed. I also felt like the roles of their team were very well defined. I feel like with our team, the roles of our team were very flexible, but they were not well defined. I think better structure of the team would possibly help our team in the future. I guess what I take from this is that frontend development and a clean frontend are essential to creating the image of a stable, functioning program/product. . Reflection . Overall, I would say this has been a learning experience for me and our team. Our team learned that requirements and a plan should be developed and be completely known. We would have saved ourselves a lot of trouble if we had known that an API would be required beforehand. Additionally, I learned myself that ensuring that I completely understand everything is very important. I learned from watching other people that it pays to be well prepared. Our team was very unprepared for this event, and we were practically scrambling to get everything together. I think that next time we have some sort of deadline, the last 2 days should be testing and ensuring that the product functions, not trying to fit as much into our program as possible. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Computing and programming is usable in all different types of jobs . Pathways? . Computer science, computer information, cyber security, computer engineering (in terms of computing) . Lots of different STEM pathways a calstste . different professors and their emails were given at this event, I could contact them for help (idk if i will but it is there) . Cool clubs at calstate (robotics club, cybersecurity club, etc.) . Internships . An internshp is a period of work experence offered by an organizatio . Joining clubs can help you find internships . Networking is also very helpful to finding internships . check ur emails . look up internship opportunities . AVOID UNPAID INTERNSHIPS . You can apply even if you feel underqualified. worse thing is rejection . cool summer scholars program to help you be involved in research, also get paid. . Quantum bridge program: . you get to study quantum stuff if ur applied to calstate uni . cool research a Cal state as well . paying 4 college . grants are money from govt. for you to go to college . You can get loans :/ . try to avoid loans . 2 different kinds: subsidized loan and unsubsidized loan: . subsidized reduces interest . unsubsidized puts interest on you right after graduation . applying for scholarship . Apply for FAFSA, studentaid.gov . Look up “undergraduate scholarship applications” . You can get payed if you pursue masters degree . conclusion . there was a lot of helpful advice in this presentation about life in college and advice for paying for college, getting internships, etc. I do feel like there was more about Cal state than actual helpful advice, but there as definetly some key takeaways from this event. Biggest thing I can take away from this is that there are a lot of benefits from expanding your circle of connections like increased internship opportunities. Another key takeaway is that there are a lot of ways for students to reduce the cost of college, however you need to put in some work to reduce your cost of college. Lastly, Calstate, and most likely other colleges, will have different research and internship programs for people to apply for that can have great benefits for students, however you need to find these opportunities through googling, hearing it from people, or just checking email or notifications often. . extra photos and a video . . . .

            "content": "our presentation to teacher and others . I think that our presentation to the teacher was good, although there wasn’t much we could mess up. . We had: . 4 different features with incoropration with an sqlite database, . fetching from our main deployment for a couple of our features and printing it out onto the frontend (GH pages) . using post method to allow users to post to the database, . and API for the frontend to fetch from for our features. . Our presentation went smoothly and we made sure to highlight our full stack and our ability to fetch and post from the database. If we did the presentation to teacher again, there isn’t much different we could change except for maybe also showing the Sqlite database being viewable on vscode and it changing with the post methods on the website. . other projects . One project I viewed was a Flight Planner Project. This project did not have a functioning database nor did it have fetch or even API’s to fetch from. Although their project was broken and didn’t really have full stack, i felt like their frontend was well designed and they definetly put effort into designing their frontend. Maybe if they focused more on getting full stack up before design and frontend,, things would have been better for them. . . I saw another project that had a strong focus on users and storing user data. This was interesting for me because our project barely put any emphasis on users, but focused more on creative features. For their project, they stored users in a database and could store user scores from the games on their page on a leaderboard. This was interesting for me because all our team was focused on was getting this database up and fetching, but they also apparently could also use that data for a leaderboard and basically interact with the data or at least sort it. Adding a more in depth user system for us could have definently been a worthwhile endeavor for our project. . final reflection . I feel like our project met the mark, however didn’t go above and beyond and explore other extra features. Things like a user system were planned from the start, but were never developed due to difficulties and lack of time to develop. On the other hand, meeting the mark was still quite difficult, as developing the database and getting fetch and post to work took a lot of effort, and judging from other’s struggle to get their project into functionality, I think that meeting the mark for this project was difficult but more than enough for me and our team. Maybe next time we will have a more well developed project to show at N@TM. . other arts classes . . . . . these other projects were definently more eye-catching for general visitors than our project, but I still feel like a cool program that was technically impressive could be as cool as a live music performance or a nice ceramic item. If our project had a really cool technical showcase, it may have been something worth showing off. .",

I will also need to record a video demonstrating program functionality. I also need to create a write up for my performance task that fulfills each of the points on the CB perofmrnace task. . From the project I will use my own feature for my College Board performance task. this feature I will be taking for use in the performance task will be a program that gives the user a random fact/random word from a list, and allow users be tested on a random word’s definition . code . The code will have a main function that creates a random word definition question by pulling from a question list, then it will compare a user’s answer to the right answer and either output correct or not correct. There will also be a second function that just puts a random fact/word in the markdown fact/word table. although the 2nd function for random words/facts is done, creating the 2nd function that creates and tests the random queston is unfinished. Ideally, It will pull a random word question and then compare the user’s answer to the correct answer, then output to the user whether or not they got the question right or wrong. . College Board rubric (does it fulfil requirements?) . Row 1 . the program I am writing has an input (the answer to the questions) and output, as well as functionality and purpose. The purpose of the program is to entertain and educate the user by providing them with a cool fact by using the program . Row 2 . I do have a list that does store data and it is accessed by a function, and the data in it is used for the program for the better . Row 3 . the list I am using does manage complexity by storing the fact data and a solution without the list would be unecceccarily complicated, yet plausible. I’m thinking I will make a solution for not using list but if that is too hard I will explain why program can’t be written without it. . Row 4 . I do have a function for calling random facts, but I plan on making a seperate function for questions that will include parameters and contribute to the program. EXPLICIT PARAMETERS IMPORTANT . UPDATE: have the function for generating questions now and it has an explicit parameter for the correct answer of the question. . Row 5 . My function will use sequencing by simply needing certain code parts to run before others, selection by using if else statements for right or wrong answer, and iteration to keep the question going until right answer is given. . UPDATE: I now have a function that includes sequencing, (the function), selection (if else statement for correct answer or not), and iteration (a while loop that checks if answer is right or wrong after 1st time question is wrong). . Row 6 . My testing will be passing in an incorrect answer and a correct answer and showing how the program reacts to those, may need to be change in future according to needs. . video plan . for the video I plan to showcase the page refreshing and giving new facts/words, and then showcase adding a right and wrong answer to my question and showing how it tells you if you are right or wrong. . here of the steps of the video: . 1: open up the feature and press the button that activates the 1st function to show how I can pull random facts/words from my list. . 2: interact with the random question and type in a wrong answer, then press button to check answer and show getting it wrong. . 3: finally, type in correct answer and show the program giving an output that shows I got the game right. .",

            "content": "score . . wrong question 1 reflection . . I got this question wrong because I didn’t think hard enough for the 1st option and didn’t realize that the age 18 would not have outputted the desired output, as both the 1st and 2nd requirements would be met, since 18 is greater than 16 but also equal or less than 18. This had to have been just a minor error or just carelessness on my part, as I succeeded on questions similar to this in the same test. I also didn’t think that the 3rd algorithm would work because I thought the number 16 would have failed, but age 16 is one of the potential ages that needs to output true. looking back on this problem, I must have made this error when looking at the NOT(AGE &lt; 16)), as I may have thought that this meant that 16 wouldn’t work as there is no equal to sign under the inequality. I was just being careless this time around. . wrong question 2 reflection . . For this one, I picked the first algorithm and got the question wrong because I thought that the function would technically work as if it was repeated, it would give the right circles. my error here was that I didn’t count the first runthrough of the repeat section when looking at the code, and thus didn’t recognize that the algorithm would fail, as it would only draw 2 full circles before stopping. it uses up one of it’s repeats just to create a 0x0 circle that doesn’t show up, therefore It can’t finish the other 3 circles as it only does the circle drawing thing 2 more times. If im being honest I recognized that the 3rd function also technically worked, but since I saw the 1st function first, I just went with the 1st 2 instead of 2 and 3. I just needed to be more careful. . weird question I got right but had no idea how to do . . to solve this problem I needed to use hexadecimal system. base 16 number 56 would be 516^1 + 616^0 = 80 + 6 = 86 which is V. I guessed on this one and got it right, but I didn’t know how to do it because I forgot how to do binary/decimal stuff, so I need to review that for the AP test. . 5 goes in 1st place, 6 goes in 0th place, then multiply by base^decimal place. 5*16^1 + 5 *16^0 = 80 + 6 = 86, 86 corresponded to v. . final reflection . most of my mistakes that I made were dumb errors that could have been fixed with a more careful eye, so next time I will be sure to pay very close attention to small details in these questions on the real test. Unlike coding, where I can make small errors and then easily fix them after testing, I don’t get any second chances on the AP test, so I need to make sure that I run through each option and don’t get lazy. I think that having a piece of paper and writing through some of the more complex algorithms when working on the AP test would have some benefit, as it would eliminate some potential chances for errors. .",

You can add stuff to lists with .append(expression) . for_loop this is a loop that pulls data out of a list def for_loop(): print(“For loop output n”) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) . while_loop iterates through stuff similarily to for_loop, but this time it only iterates through a set amount while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(“While loop output n”) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return . while_loop() . recursive loop this loops through itself by calling itself repeatedly. def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return . print(“Recursive loop output n”) recursive_loop(0) .

          "content": "basic vocab terms definition . list | data type that can have data appended to it with .append(expression). | . dictionary | data type that stores data in key:value pairs | . selection | decision or question an algorithm may reach, in which case the algorithm now has options. | . Algorithm | A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations. | . iteration | when something is repeated. usually done using loops. REPEAT N TIMES is pseudocode for this. | . conditional statements | when the code acts based on different conditions based on user input or stored data. | . NESTED CONDITIONAL | conditional statement in a conditional statement | . Sequencing | when you do certain steps in order, for example, doing the first step then the second then the third, etc. | . Selection | when the programmer decides between two different outcomes. | . variable | a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used | . objects | a structure that can take on a data-type value | . Concatenation | when you add strings or integers together. can’t add strings and integers | . Hexadecimal | numbering system from 1-16. 1-9 are numbers and 9-16 go from a-f | . bits | A binary digit, either 0 or 1 | . bytes | group of binary digits operating as a unit | . floating point | positive or negative numbers that can include decimals | . .upper | simply makes a string uppercase | . .lower | changes string to lowercase | . RGB | a mix of colors using binary. (x, y, z) determines color, x is red, y is green, z is blue. 0 is dark | . code vocab . if, else, and elif statements . an if statement will run a set of code if a certain requirement is met. adding else will mean another piece of code runs if the requirement is not met. . lastly, elif means that if that first condition is not met but the other is, that code in the elif will run. . code example below . if (time &lt; 10) { greeting = &quot;Good morning&quot;; } else if (time &lt; 20) { greeting = &quot;Good day&quot;; } else { greeting = &quot;Good evening&quot;; } . nested statements . a nested statement will just be that statement within the same statement. . example: . if a = 2: if b = 3: print(&quot;ok&quot;) this would be a nested if statement as it is an if statement in an if statement . for and while loops . these are loops that iterate through something or keep something running . i = 1 while i &lt; 6: print(i) i += 1 . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for x in fruits: print(x) . for x in range(2, 6): print(x) this one uses range, printing all numbers from 2 to 5 . Boolean expression . statements that can be true or false . ``a = 200 b = 33 . if b &gt; a: print(“b is greater than a”) else: print(“b is not greater than a”)`` . this is boolean expression because the 2 outputs are true or false. . ### simple concatenation ex: . a = 1 b = 2 print(a + b) plus sign is concatenation . truth tables . truth tables essentially can be used to simplify code and show what the outputs for things can be . x y x &amp; y . t | t | t | . t | f | f | . f | t | f | . f | f | f | . example .",
