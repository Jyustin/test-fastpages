ideas for performance task:
1: simple game, perhaps snake (a line moves across a screen and grows when it passes berry units, but dies when it hits the border of the screen or hits itself)
meets row 1: idea will require explaining of how code works
meets row 2: requires snake data to be stored
meets row 3: will need lists for berries
meets row 4: will need this
meets row 5: will definetly need to use some sort of algorithm for generating berries
meets row 6: will need functions to work
I think this is a good idea, but I feel like it will 


2: tic-tac-toe against a cpu (play tic-tac-toe against a cpu that randomly selects tiles, implementing cpu could be hard)

3: text based adventure game (an adventure game based entirely on text by computer, pretty easy to build)
