<p>What I learned from grading this submission is that you need to be thorough with your project to ensure that most of the requirements are met. I also realized that 
the performance task I make can be made in outside coding sites like code.org or even scratch I think, so if my ideas are really hard to code or I struggle with syntax,
I could potentially code my project in an ide with simple code blocks. lastly, I thik its important that my performance task has a defined function and reason for existing, so I don’t miss the first 2 points.</p>

<p>For my performance task, I should make sure that the algorithm I make is entirely student developed and that I completely understand how it functions, 
otherwise I will lose points for not completely describing the algorithm I make and how I describe it. Also, I should make sure to use College board vocabulary
like iteration in my description of the algorithm so I know that my algorithm contains all of those neccessary requirements.</p>

<h1 id="reflection-2">reflection</h1>

<p>What I learned is that program purpose is especially important and that getting program function and program purpose is a mistake that someone could easily make.</p>

<p>program functionality “is The behavior of a program during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it”</p>

<p>program purpose is “The problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program”</p>

<p>college board vocab is vital to this!!!!!</p>

<p>I think that I didn’t pay enough attention to all of the details of the submission and how they fit into the overall rubric. I should remember to
specify how the inputs im putting into the program during testing work with the algorithm, to ensure that I don’t lose points
on simply testing the program.</p>

<h1 id="overall-reflection">overall reflection</h1>

<p>I think that I was a little too leniant on my grading and didn’t notice obvious point deductions. In order to avoid not being docked points for my 
Performance task, I will remember to double check that my work fits college board criteria, as well as review and use college board vocab to
ensure that my written portion is thorough enough to get enough points.</p>

<p>My program will need a list with multiple elements that uses data for certain things and manages complexity
a well defined function and purpose, an algorithm that plays an integral role in the program’s function and uses iteration,
sequencing, and selection, and well defined user inputs and outputs.</p>
