<a class="anchor" href="#wrong-question-1-reflection" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>wrong question 1 reflection</h1>

<p><img src="/test-fastpages/images/old1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I got this question wrong because I didn’t think hard enough for the 1st option and didn’t realize that the age 18 would not have outputted the desired output, as both the 1st and 2nd requirements would be met, since 18 is greater than 16 but also equal or less than 18. This had to have been just a minor error or just carelessness on my part, as I succeeded on questions similar to this in the same test. I also didn’t think that the 3rd algorithm would work because I thought the number 16 would have failed, but age 16 is one of the potential ages that needs to output true. looking back on this problem, I must have made this error when looking at the NOT(AGE &lt; 16)), as I may have thought that this meant that 16 wouldn’t work as there is no equal to sign under the inequality. I was just being careless this time around.</p>

<p>For this one, I picked the first algorithm and got the question wrong because I thought that the function would technically work as if it was repeated, it would give the right circles. my error here was that I didn’t count the first runthrough of the repeat section when looking at the code, and thus didn’t recognize that the algorithm would fail, as it would only draw 2 full circles before stopping. it uses up one of it’s repeats just to create a 0x0 circle that doesn’t show up, therefore It can’t finish the other 3 circles as it only does the circle drawing thing 2 more times. If im being honest I recognized that the 3rd function also technically worked, but since I saw the 1st function first, I just went with the 1st 2 instead of 2 and 3. I just needed to be more careful.</p>

<p>to solve this problem I needed to use hexadecimal system. base 16 number 56 would be 5<em>16^1 + 6</em>16^0 = 80 + 6 = 86 which is V. I guessed on this one and got it right, but I didn’t know how to do it because I forgot how to do binary/decimal stuff, so I need to review that for the AP test.</p>

<p>5 goes in 1st place, 6 goes in 0th place, then multiply by base^decimal place. 5*16^1 + 5 *16^0 = 80 + 6 = 86, 86 corresponded to v.</p>

<p>most of my mistakes that I made were dumb errors that could have been fixed with a more careful eye, so next time I will be sure to pay very close attention to small details in these questions on the real test. Unlike coding, where I can make small errors and then easily fix them after testing, I don’t get any second chances on the AP test, so I need to make sure that I run through each option and don’t get lazy. I think that having a piece of paper and writing through some of the more complex algorithms when working on the AP test would have some benefit, as it would eliminate some potential chances for errors.</p>
