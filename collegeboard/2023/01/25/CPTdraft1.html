<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3.a.i:
the program I made is coded primarily in javascript, with html elements used to display certain elements. The purpose of the program is to entertain and test the user by providing them with a math question that tests their ability to solve basic math problems and keeps their mind sharp.

3.a.ii.
the video shows the user using the "create math question", then inputting answers in until the user gets the right one.

3.a.iii:
the input shown is the submitted answer the user puts in the text box, and the output is either an alert saying you got it right or a different alert forcing the user to answer until he got the question right.

    ![](/test-fastpages/image/listiterate.png)

3.b.iii:
"quest" is the name of the list

3.b.iiii:
this data is important because it contains all of the questions that the user could generate

3.b.iiiii:
without the use of a list for storing the questions, I would have to store all of the questions in individual variables, then edit my function so that it grabs a random variable defined as a question, instead of easily just grabbing a random question from a list instead.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![](/test-fastpages/image/truefunction.png)

![](/test-fastpages/image/button.png)


3.c.iii:
the function test(ans) is used for the program to check if the user's answer is correct or not. 

3.c.iiii:
This function first takes the user's text that they have put in the text box, then assigns it to the variable ans. Next The function then runs an if statement to see if the user's text is the exact same as questoutANS, which is the correctAnswer class of the object we pulled from the list earlier. if the if statement is true, an alert will play to notify the user the question is right, and a element in an html table will change to depict questoutANS. there is an elseif in this if statement for when ans is not an integer, in which case the function alerts the user that they have not typed in a number. there is an else statement in the if statement that when triggered (ans is not the same as the questoutANS), will run a while loop where while the loop is true, a prompt will appear where the user must type in the correct answer and submit it. an if statement in the while loop is used to see if the userInput is equal to questoutANS, where if it is true, the while loop breaks and a msg is printed to the user, otherwise the function prints an alert msg and the loop goes back to the user prompt.

<p>First call:
First example will be when the user presses the button that creates the question and the user puts in the number 8 to the question what is 4+4?</p>

<p>Second call:
First example will be when the user presses the button that creates the question and the user puts in the number 9 to the question what is 2*2?</p>

<p>3 d.ii.
Condition(s) tested by first call:
In line 62, the if statement compares the number “8” to the correct answer
Condition(s) tested by second call:
In line 62, the if statement compares the number 9 to the correct answer
3.d.iii.
Results of the first call:
The result of the first call is an alert telling the user they got the question right, and the function (test) finishing
Results of the second call:
The result of the second call is the function runs the while loop in the function and puts the user in a text prompt until they submit the right answer into said text prompt</p>
